Mate is a fork of the much loved Gnome 2 but uses the modern backend of GTK3 for a stable, modern and configurable yet traditional desktop. The guides in this section will show you how get the best out of Mate.

Mate uses LightDM as its Display Manger. To configure and customise LightDM see <https://github.com/kororaproject/kp-documentation/wiki/LightDM> also note the additional section for Mate at the end of that guide.
