# Getting Korora

You've taken a look at the site and you might be wondering to yourself, "How can I take a look at this great Linux distribution?"

Well, wonder no more.

From what you've seen on the website, Korora has a special blend of aesthetics and functionality, and you've already seen that Korora aims to make Linux easy for new users while still being powerful enough for use by experts.

Now you'd like to give it a try.

Visit the [Download Page](https://kororaproject.org/download) to choose a version to download (below you will find a brief overview of each of the desktop environments available to Korora users).

The minimum installation requirements for Korora are:
* 64 bit Intel-compatible CPU
* 2GB memory (RAM)
* 20GB disk space

Follow the instructions on the Download Page to [create a Live USB stick](https://kororaproject.org/support/documentation/creating-bootable-media). We encourage you to first try Korora using a Live USB stick to get a better idea on how the distro will perform on your hardware.

(Note: Making a live USB stick is the preferred method of trying and/or installing Korora. You can also burn a Korora DVD, however our experience has found that running a live DVD in many cases does not give you a true reflection of Korora's performance. For installing purposes, however, a live DVD will work just fine).

Korora gives you the option of five desktop environments, which are:

**CINNAMON:** Cinnamon is built atop core GNOME technologies like GTK and provides a more traditional desktop while including some advanced features. Cinnamon is very flexible and configurable. For more information on Korora Cinnamon, visit our [Cinnamon page](https://kororaproject.org/discover/cinnamon).

**GNOME:** Sweeping away the clutter, GNOME's new desktop takes elegance to a new level. GNOME is a simple and easy-to-use desktop which is the most beautiful version ever, including a new visual theme, a refined new font, and carefully crafted animations. For more information on Korora GNOME, visit our [Gnome page](https://kororaproject.org/discover/gnome).

**KDE:** KDE's Plasma Desktop offers a beautiful desktop that takes complete advantage of modern computing technology. Using visual effects and scalable graphics, the desktop experience is not only smooth but also pleasing to the eye.

**MATE:** MATE, a fork of GNOME 2, continues the long tradition of providing an intuitive and attractive desktop environment while adding a much needed overhaul in both back and front-end functionality. For more information on Korora MATE, visit our [Mate page](https://kororaproject.org/discover/mate).

**Xfce:** A lightweight desktop with speed and function, Xfce maintains a visually appealing desktop while aiming to be fast while using a lower amount of system resources. Xfce offers both speed and functionality as its core strength. For more information on Korora Xfce, visit our [Xfce page](https://kororaproject.org/discover/xfce).
