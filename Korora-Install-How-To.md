# Installing Korora - Video Guide

Being a Fedora Remix, Korora inherits the [Anaconda ](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda)installer for all of our images. Having undergone a massive re-write in 2012 it has seen solid improvements since then. This presentation walks you through the installation of Korora onto your hard disk and although it was created for version 18, it is still relevant for the latest release.
